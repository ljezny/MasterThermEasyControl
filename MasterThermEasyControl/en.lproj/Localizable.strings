I have been developing freelance mobile applications for several years. I also own a MasterTherm heat pump on my home. The official application for controlling this pump did not suit my design and usage and therefore I tried to publish my own solution for controlling this pump. I do not plan to set temperature curves and more complex parameters yet. In my free time, I work on development and new features and add them as needed. A watch app is planned.\n\nI'll be happy to hear any comments you make about using the app and report any issues. Contact form is available after login.\n\nOnly heat pumps with firmware version higher than 11 are currently supported. Multiple circuits are supported, but this is not thoroughly tested because I own a single circuit pump. I would also like to support the solar and swimming pool in the application, so if you have a solar or swimming pool, please contact us. I tried and tested the application on my own heat pump and I did not cause any defects. If you still have concerns, please use the original app. The application is entirely up to you.";
